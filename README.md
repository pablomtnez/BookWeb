# BOOKWEB üìö
BookWeb is a project that leverages the OpenLibrary API to allow users to search for books, save their favorites, and view detailed information about each book. The application is built with a microservices architecture, ensuring scalability and modularity.

## MICROSERVICES ‚öôÔ∏è

### 1. AUTHENTICATION MICROSERVICE ü™™
This microservice is developed in Python (FastAPI) and manages user registration, login, and favorite books. User data is stored in a MySQL database.

#### INSTALLATION ‚öôÔ∏è
To run it, you need to download or clone the repository and have Python installed.

Install the dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

You also need to set up the database on your computer:

#### MAC USER
To create the database, run the following command:

    mysql -u root -p < ./db/db.sql

#### WINDOWS USER
To create the database, run the following command:

    mysql -u root -p < .\db\db.sql

When prompted, enter your MySQL root user password (default is usually `root`).

#### EXECUTION ‚ñ∂Ô∏è
To run the project, execute the following command:

    uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

#### DOCUMENTATION üìÑ
API documentation is available at [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs) after starting the server.

### 2. BOOKS MICROSERVICE üìñ
This microservice is developed in Node.js and interacts with MongoDB to manage book data. It supports operations like adding, retrieving, and updating book records. The API is documented using Swagger.

#### INSTALLATION ‚öôÔ∏è
To run it, you need to download or clone the repository and have Node.js and MongoDB installed.

Install the required dependencies:

    npm install axios cors dotenv express mongoose swagger-jsdoc swagger-ui-express

#### CONFIGURATION ‚öôÔ∏è
- Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following content:

      MONGO_URI=<your_mongodb_connection_string>
      PORT=9000

- Replace `<your_mongodb_connection_string>` with your MongoDB connection string.

#### EXECUTION ‚ñ∂Ô∏è
To run the project, execute the following command:

    npm start

#### DOCUMENTATION üìÑ
API documentation is available at [http://localhost:9000/api-docs](http://localhost:9000/api-docs) after starting the server.

## FRONTEND üñ•Ô∏è
The frontend is a web application developed using React. It allows users to register, log in, search for books, save favorites, and view detailed book information.

#### INSTALLATION ‚öôÔ∏è
To run it, you need to download or clone the repository and have Node.js installed.

Install the required dependencies:

    npm install react react-dom react-router-dom axios tailwindcss react-modal

#### STRUCTURE ‚öôÔ∏è
- **`src/components`**: Contains reusable React components.
- **`src/hooks`**: Custom hooks for additional functionality.
- **`src/api.js`**: Manages API calls.
- **`public`**: Static files like `favicon.ico` and `index.html`.

#### EXECUTION ‚ñ∂Ô∏è
To run the project, execute the following command:

    npm start

The application will be available at [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001).

## FURTHER STEPS üöÄ
- Ensure `.env` files are set up with correct API keys and database credentials for each microservice.
- Verify the OpenLibrary and MongoDB configurations before running the project.
